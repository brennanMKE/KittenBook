# Kitten Book

Welcome the Kitten Book, the premier social platform for kitten photos.

## Learning about Storyboards

If you are new to working with Xcode and Storyboards you can watch this [series of videos](http://www.smallsharptools.com/cascadesf/storyboards/) to get started.

## Tasks

Please use `tasks.sh` to run routine tasks such as building and testing. Use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to open the working directory to run these tasks with the built in task runner.
